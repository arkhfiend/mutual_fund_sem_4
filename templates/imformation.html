              Coinsurance in insurance, is the splitting or spreading of risk
              among multiple parties. In the U.S. insurance market, coinsurance
              is the joint assumption of risk between the insurer and the
              insured. In health insurance, coinsurance is sometimes used
              synonymously with copayment, but copayment is really fixed while
              coinsurance is a percentage that the insurer pays after the
              insurance policy's deductible is exceeded up to the policy's stop
              loss.
